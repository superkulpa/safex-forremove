Module 3 have 3 subroutines. All 3 a nearly the same.
See safex.png

First we need 3 new tables
table 1: H_1
Fields: Idnr (Identnr, Int)
	Timestamp
	Value (Int)
	Temperature (Int)

table 2: H_2
Fields:	Idnr
	Timestamp
	value

table 3: H_3
Fields: Idnr
	Timestamp
	value

Is the timestamp value coded like in MS SQL Server, we need the datetime value


Subroutine H_1
If the Flag h1 (variable ovens) = true See module init

Subroutine H_2
If the Flag h2 (variable rooms) = true See module init

Subroutine H_3
If the Flag h3 (variable leaks) = true See module init



Subroutine H_1 description:
Get the value from analoge I/O P9 AIN4 and AIN5
Then we need a equation (now a dummy)

Multiply Value(AIN4) with 1+AIN5/100 (dummy equation)

open the table H_1 (order of timestamp descending)
get the timestamp and value from row 1.
compare the timestamp with the actual date time. if it is older then 1 minute, append a new row and insert the actual
values you have read out (value = result of the equation) also save the temperature of AIN5 and the actual date time.

If the old set of data from the table newer then 1 minute, compare the Value with your equation if it is in a range of
+- 3% of the new value do nothing. otherwise add the new data to the table.

Subroutine H_2 description:
It the same like H_1 but without calculation and with out temperature.
You have only to save the value field under the same condition like H_1. The value is P9 AIN6

Subroutine H_3 is easy
You have override the value of the dataset of table H_3. No Append. So we only have 1 data set in the table.
The value is P9 AIN6. Do it not faster then 1 time per second.

Thats all. I hope you understand this and I haven't vergott anything.
