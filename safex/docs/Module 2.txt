Module 2 heart-beat.

Description
The 3B start with the start module. In the start module the database will be initialzed. Here the table <start> start
will create if is not crated. The field run_stop will be set to .true.
Then this module is finished.

Then we have to initialize the watchdog. The watchdog will togle the port (P8/5 GPIO_2 alive) every 100ms on and off.
(100ms on and 100ms off) So the electronic knows that the Program is running.

After Initializing this the modul <init> will be start.
This module is done. It looks in the table for a new date then <init> will set this parameter and/or set I/O's 
likw H_valve and N_valve.

There are no new fields at this moment!

Flags in the picture:

other please ignore first. I have to compleate the diagramm first.
